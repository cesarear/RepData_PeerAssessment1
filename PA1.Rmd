## Loading and preprocessing the data
### Reads activity.zip from current working directory
```{r, echo=TRUE}
actData <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip", "activity.csv"))
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?  
### Get total steps per day, ignore the missing values in the dataset
```{r, echo=TRUE}
stepsPerDay <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = actData, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(aggregate(steps ~ date, data = stepsPerDay, sum, na.rm=TRUE)$steps, main="Total number of steps per day", 
     xlab="Steps")
```

### Mean total number of steps taken per day  
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(stepsPerDay$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Median total number of steps taken per day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
median(stepsPerDay$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

### Time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
